# Tapir.jl

Documentation for Tapir.jl is on it's way!

Note 02/07/2024: The first round of documentation has arrived.
This is largely targetted at those who are interested in contributing to Tapir.jl -- you can find this work in the "Understanding Tapir.jl" section of the docs.
There is more to to do, but it should be sufficient to understand how AD works in principle, and the core abstractions underlying Tapir.jl.

Note (29/05/2024): I (Will) am currently actively working on the documentation.
It will be merged in chunks over the next month or so as good first drafts of sections are completed.
Please don't be alarmed that not all of it is here!
